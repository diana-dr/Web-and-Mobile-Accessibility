# Web-and-Mobile-Accessibility
I only edited 2 files: index.html and index.js.
I made detailed comments in the code, all the places I changed has commented.
Also, I uploaded my report draft for understanding.
One small question could be discussed: I am not sure about Exercise3_Drop-down menu part, finally the function is achieved, but I only used "aria-expanded" and didn't use "aria-haspopup".
